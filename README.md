# msobriquet's personal website

A static site to host my creative side: poems, blog posts, games, etc. Always a work in progress.

I'm using this project as a playground to mess with HTML and CSS and learn new frameworks and tools. 

Currently working on adding: 
-database for blog posts


Future Features:
-textboxes on hover
