                Hey! Welcome to my little mind palace. I'm currently a college student, originally studying linguistics, then computer science,
                and now mainly math. I've found that I am not satisfied until I know how things tick, and to that end I am endlessly curious, which
                can also be overwhelming at times. I feel much more grounded when I communicate the gaps in my knowledge, where my interests
                are taking me, and personal (and often poetic) reflections. Hence, this website now exists as a fun way to coalate these thoughts,
                since I simply cannot handle social media (see: overwhelm). First and foremost, this is a place for me to mess around and satisfy my whims, but I hope
                you enjoy your time here!  <br>
                <br> 

                If you have any thoughts on anything I've written that you'd like to chat about, feel free to <a href="mailto:danir8228@gmail.com">email me!</a>
